Bow Lite is a cross-platform library for Typed Functional Programming in Swift. It is a lightweight version of [Bow](https://github.com/bow-swift/bow) where some complexity, like Higher Kinded Type emulation, has been removed.

## Documentation

All documentation is available in [our website](https://bow-swift.io/). Notice that the documentation presents all examples using the full version of Bow. Although Bow Lite maintains compatibility with the API of Bow, there may be cases where there are some variations.

## Modules

Bow Lite offers an umbrella module `BowLite` that contains:

- **BowLiteCore**: a collection of the main data types typically used in FP projects, that you can find in the core module of Bow.
- **BowLiteEffects**: an implementation of the `IO` and `EnvIO` data types to deal with side effects, that you can find in the BowEffects module.
- **BowLiteOptics**: a monomorphic implementation of some optics, that you can find in the BowOptics module.

## How to get it

Bow Lite is available using Swift Package Manager. You can include it using the corresponding wizard in Xcode, or adding the following line to your `Package.swift` manifest:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/bow-swift/bow-lite.git", from: "{version}")
```

```swift
import BowLite
```
